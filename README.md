# Shining a light in the Black Box of Neural Networks
### Extracting Semantics from Deep Neural Networks using Knowledge Graphs, Communities, and Shapley-values

## Running the experiments
Experiments can be reproduced by running both the Python-notebook in the `src`
folder. One prerequisite is to install all libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.

Notebook for the models:
- **Baseline**: [titanic-dnn-classification-baseline.ipynb](src%2Ftitanic%2Ftitanic-dnn-classification-baseline.ipynb)
- **Experiment**: [titanic-dnn-classification-experiment.ipynb](src%2Ftitanic%2Ftitanic-dnn-classification-experiment.ipynb)
